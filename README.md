# FlorisCodes

**FlorisCodes** is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my projects and skills. The website is built using Laravel and TailwindCSS, with a focus on creating a modern and responsive design. This portfolio is aimed at demonstrating my capabilities to future employers and highlighting the work I’ve done.

## Project Overview

This portfolio was initially designed in Canva, where I created a visual concept that I later translated into code. The goal is to provide a clear and professional overview of my work while making the website visually appealing and easy to navigate. The use of Laravel for the backend and TailwindCSS for the frontend ensures the project is built with modern, scalable technologies.
